This repository contains the research on sales forecast for one year using Google's Big Query and Data Studio. SQL, Python and some JS were used to complete given tasks.

**Notebooks folder** contains Jupyter Notebooks with some additional research on time series stationarity. You can find code to count **Sample Entropy** there. Also, the **ADF test** was done in these notebooks, which prooved the stationarity of given data. **Test for seasonality** was performed there too. It showed that data is pretty similar each half a year.
